# Statcore

This is a hobby project to implement common stats and ML algorithms.

This is purely for fun + education and should be used... at extreme personal risk.


I'm going to use numpy arrays and matrices, but implement most other algorithms
and datastructures myself (for educational purposes only).

The usage of cython and c_extensions is completely recreational.
